<!-- ABOUT INFO -->
## About 
There aren't many differences between QR-ME and the [``forked repo``](https://github.com/pudymody/firefox-qr), It's a very well put together add-on. The repo that inspired that one was [this one](https://github.com/smoqadam/url-to-qrcode-firefox-addon). 

### What I wanted to solve
The problem I was running into was running into before launching ``QR-ME`` was this: 

- Firefox allows for you to transfer tabs, only if you're signed in.
- So if I wanted to read something on my phone that I was reading on my laptop I'd need to manually look it up.
- The ``firefox-qr`` add-on satisfies this, but what I have done with this fork is remove the functionality that allows you to download the qr code. 
- I removed the functionality because I wanted to remove any possibility of someone downloading a QR to a site they didn't want saved and then running the risk of that download being on their machine and into the wrong hands.
- I may sound paranoid but better safe than sorry, and its not necessary. 

## How it works
Once downloaded, the add-on will live in the address bar, this is where ``firefox-qr`` shined versus the OG add-on.

It will look something like this:
